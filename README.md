# MagniRead

An assistive reading application designed for individuals with impaired vision. MagniRead can take a snapshot of the webcam's video capture, giving users a stable image that they can comfortably read from. Unlike many other assistive reading technologies, it isn't necessary to physically move the camera or reading material, just take a snapshot, then zoom and drag the image wherever you please!

## Getting Started 
### Pre-requisites

* A modern OS (Windows, OS X, Linux, etc.)
* An external webcam that can be mounted

### Installing
(WIP)

## TODO

### Upcoming
* Add button icons in main window
* Show sample images in settings window
* Configure buttons in settings window
* Fullscreen mode
* Stream live video footage from webcam
* Take snapshot of video footage and display
* Implement display adjustments (zoom, brightness, contrast, etc.)

### Ideas
* Also drag image by clicking mouse button (like ClickLock on Windows)

## Dependencies
* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) - An open source graphical user interface (GUI)
