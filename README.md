# MagniRead

An assistive reading application designed for individuals with impaired vision. MagniRead can take a snapshot from the webcam's live video footage, giving users a stable image that they can comfortably read from. Unlike many other assistive reading technologies, it isn't necessary to physically move the camera or reading material to view a magnified image. Just take a snapshot, then zoom and drag the image wherever you please! MagniRead also includes settings for modifying the image's brightness, contrast, etc.

## Getting Started 
### Pre-requisites

* A modern OS (Windows, OS X, Linux, etc.)
* A webcam (recommended: external and mountable)

### Installing
Currently, this program can only be run as a project in the QtCreator IDE. Build and installation details coming soon...

## TODO
* Drag view by clicking instead of holding mouse button
* Show sample images in settings dialog box
* Fullscreen mode
* Display live video footage from webcam
* Take snapshot of video footage
* Implement image adjustment settings (zoom, brightness, contrast, etc.)
* Create production build & cross-platform support

## Dependencies
* [Qt 5.11](https://www.qt.io/) - An open source graphical user interface (GUI) API.
