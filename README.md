# MagniRead

An assistive reading application designed for individuals with impaired vision. MagniRead can take a snapshot of the webcam's video capture, giving users a stable image that they can comfortably read from. Unlike many other assistive reading technologies, it isn't necessary to physically move the camera or reading material, just take a snapshot, then zoom and drag the image wherever you please!
